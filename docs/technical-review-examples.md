## Tips for Effective Reviews üí°

### 1. Be Specific About Focus Areas
Instead of a general review, specify what aspects you want to emphasize:
- `Focus on: security, performance`
- `Focus on: code quality, maintainability`
- `Focus on: architecture, scalability`

### 2. Include Context Files
Reference related files that provide context:
```
Review these files: @main-component.tsx @related-service.ts @types.ts
Context files: @README.md @docs/architecture.md
```

### 3. Specify Review Depth
Indicate whether you want a quick scan or comprehensive review:
- `Quick architectural review focusing on design patterns`
- `Comprehensive security audit with detailed recommendations`
- `Performance review with specific optimization suggestions`

### 4. Use for Different Stages
- **Pre-implementation:** Review designs and architecture plans
- **Mid-development:** Check progress and identify issues early
- **Pre-deployment:** Final quality and security assessment
- **Post-deployment:** Retrospective analysis and improvement planning

### 5. Follow Up on Recommendations
Use the generated implementation roadmap to:
- Track progress on recommended improvements
- Schedule follow-up reviews
- Measure success metrics
- Share learnings with the team
