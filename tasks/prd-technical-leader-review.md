# Product Requirements Document: Technical Leader Review System

## Introduction/Overview

The Technical Leader Review System is a feature that provides comprehensive code review and technical guidance from the perspective of a senior technical leader. This system analyzes code quality, architecture, and provides actionable recommendations focusing on simplicity, quick wins, and high-quality development practices. The goal is to democratize senior technical leadership insights and help development teams maintain high standards while achieving rapid, sustainable progress.

## Goals

1. **Improve Code Quality:** Systematically identify and address code quality issues across projects
2. **Accelerate Team Learning:** Provide educational feedback that helps developers grow their technical skills
3. **Reduce Technical Debt:** Proactively identify and prioritize technical debt reduction
4. **Enhance Development Velocity:** Focus on quick wins and simplicity to speed up development cycles
5. **Standardize Best Practices:** Ensure consistent application of coding standards and architectural patterns

## User Stories

- **As a Development Team Lead**, I want to get senior-level technical reviews of our codebase so that I can ensure we're following best practices and maintaining high quality standards.

- **As a Junior Developer**, I want to receive detailed, educational feedback on my code so that I can learn best practices and improve my technical skills.

- **As a Project Manager**, I want to understand the technical health of our projects and get prioritized improvement roadmaps so that I can make informed decisions about resource allocation and timelines.

- **As a Tech Lead**, I want to identify quick wins and high-impact improvements so that I can maximize our team's productivity and code quality with minimal effort.

- **As a Software Architect**, I want comprehensive architecture reviews that identify scalability issues and suggest improvements so that our systems can grow sustainably.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Code Analysis Engine:** The system must analyze provided code files and generate comprehensive technical assessments covering quality, architecture, security, and performance aspects.

2. **Requirement Extraction:** The system must identify and document technical requirements including dependencies, performance needs, security considerations, and integration points.

3. **Best Practice Evaluation:** The system must evaluate code against industry best practices including SOLID principles, clean code standards, and appropriate design patterns.

4. **Quick Wins Identification:** The system must prioritize recommendations by impact and effort, specifically highlighting high-impact, low-effort improvements.

5. **Quality Scoring:** The system must provide quantitative quality assessments with justification and specific improvement targets.

6. **Roadmap Generation:** The system must create phased implementation roadmaps with realistic timelines and effort estimates.

7. **Educational Feedback:** The system must provide explanations for recommendations to help team members understand the reasoning behind suggestions.

8. **Risk Assessment:** The system must identify technical risks, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks with mitigation strategies.

9. **Documentation Standards:** The system must evaluate and recommend improvements for code documentation, API documentation, and project documentation.

10. **Integration Compatibility:** The system must work with the existing AI Dev Tasks workflow and integrate seamlessly with the PRD and task generation process.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Automated Code Fixing:** The system will not automatically implement code changes, only provide recommendations
- **Real-time Code Review:** This is not a real-time code review tool integrated with IDEs or CI/CD pipelines
- **Team Performance Metrics:** The system will not track individual developer performance or provide team productivity analytics
- **Project Management Features:** No task tracking, sprint planning, or project management capabilities
- **Code Execution:** The system will not execute or test code, only perform static analysis and review

## Design Considerations

- **Markdown-based Output:** All reviews should be generated in clean, readable Markdown format for easy sharing and documentation
- **Consistent Structure:** Follow the established pattern of the existing `.mdc` files for seamless integration
- **Actionable Format:** Reviews should include specific code examples, effort estimates, and clear implementation steps
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Information should be organized from high-level summary to detailed technical specifics

## Technical Considerations

- **Integration with Existing Workflow:** Must integrate seamlessly with the current `create-prd.mdc`, `generate-tasks.mdc`, and `process-task-list.mdc` workflow
- **File System Integration:** Should follow the established pattern of saving outputs to the `/tasks` directory
- **Extensibility:** The review template should be flexible enough to handle different programming languages and project types
- **Performance:** Reviews should be generated efficiently without requiring extensive computational resources

## Success Metrics

1. **Code Quality Improvement:** Measured by reduced complexity metrics, improved test coverage, and fewer defects
2. **Developer Learning:** Tracked through feedback surveys and observed improvement in code quality over time
3. **Technical Debt Reduction:** Measured by decreasing technical debt scores and faster feature delivery times
4. **Adoption Rate:** Success measured by frequency of use and positive feedback from development teams
5. **Quick Wins Implementation:** Percentage of identified quick wins that are actually implemented within recommended timeframes

## Open Questions

1. Should the system support different review depths (quick scan vs. comprehensive review) based on user needs?
2. How should the system handle large codebases - should there be file size or complexity limits?
3. Should there be templates for different types of reviews (new feature, refactoring, legacy code assessment)?
4. How can we ensure the recommendations remain current with evolving best practices and technology trends?
